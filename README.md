This project uses Python's turtle library to draw the face of Crayon Shin-chan. 
It mainly includes drawing the face shape, eyebrows and eyes, mouth, and hair.

The face shape is drawn using circle() and straight lines to create the outline of the face. 
For the eyebrows and eyes, different pen thicknesses and colors are used, along with arcs and circular dots, to form the eyebrows and eyes. 
The mouth is created using the dot() function to represent a circular mouth. 
The hair is drawn with thicker lines and arcs to mimic a cartoon-style hairstyle.

Additionally, nine different colors were set, and a 3x3 chessboard grid was created, with each cell measuring 300x300 pixels. 
Each cell of the chessboard is filled with a randomly selected color to simulate the colorful background typical of pop art. 
Within each grid cell, the face of Crayon Shin-chan is drawn, creating a repetitive pop art effect.
